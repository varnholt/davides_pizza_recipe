# Davide's Pizza Recipe
The world's best pizza recipe (unmodified original text)

There we go... I am sharing with you the recipe for pizza – 3 ppl.
The dough is:

- 500g of flour (not whole meal)
- 300 ml of warm water or 200ml of warm water + 100 ml of beer (the second one is my
favorite)
- 25g of fresh yeast
- a normal spoon of salt
- a tea spoon of sugar

Basically you dissolve the sugar and yeast in the warm water (or water + beer). The result will appear
like a dirty brownish water. Please be aware if the yeast isn’t sticky in the water and turns into little balls
when you’re mixing means it is old. Therefore, I strongly suggest to stop and do it again with different
yeast as the dough won’t raise.
Once the compound is correctly done, pour it into a bowl in which you previously put the flour. Mix all
together and add salt.

After the dough is done, dirt the dough with some extra flour outside and cover with a cloth. Let it rest
for 2 hours.

Open the dough on a tray and add tomato souce
cook dough + tomato sauce for 15 mins – 200° electric oven or 180° gas oven.
add mozzarella and topping and cook for another 15-20 mins
once the pizza is cooked, cook it down a bit a add dry origan
THAT’S IT.

Please feel free to ask me more clarification if you don’t understand. I hope the process is clear enough.
Cheers
